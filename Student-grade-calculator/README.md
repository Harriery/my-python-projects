# Student Grade Calculator

This project calculates a student's year-end grade point average for four different courses. The midterm and final grades of each course are taken and the year-end average is determined with 40% of the midterm and 60% of the final. If the average is below 50, the student is evaluated as “FAIL”, if it is 50 and above, the student is evaluated as “SUCCESS”.

## Features
- Analysis for 4 courses:** Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology.
- Grade calculation:** Midterm 40%, final 60% effective.
- **Success status analysis:** Below 50 is “FAIL”, 50 and above is “SUCCESS”.
